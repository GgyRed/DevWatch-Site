## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The site follows a **restrained, institutional design language** inspired by leading global policy platforms.

Key principles:
- text-first layouts  
- generous white space  
- clear editorial hierarchy  
- minimal visual noise  
- fast load times  

The site deliberately avoids unnecessary animation, heavy JavaScript frameworks, or CMS lock-in.

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)**
- **Google Fonts** (Inter + Playfair Display)

The site is:
- GitHub Pages–ready  
- CMS-ready (future integration with headless CMS possible)  
- Accessible for non-technical content updates  

No build tools or server-side dependencies are required.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The site is intended to be deployed using **GitHub Pages**.

### Recommended setup:
- Branch: `main`
- Source: `/ (root)`
- Custom domain: optional
- HTTPS: enabled by default via GitHub Pages

Any changes pushed to the repository are reflected live once GitHub Pages is enabled.

## ✍️ Content & Editorial Control

DevWatch operates under an **editorial-led hybrid model**:

- Institutional editorials are published under **DevWatch Editorial**
- Individual authors are clearly credited
- Guest contributions are labelled and reviewed

All content adheres to DevWatch’s editorial standards of independence, clarity, and analytical integrity.

---

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Optional)

Planned or possible future improvements include:

- Headless CMS integration (e.g. Decap CMS, Strapi)
- Search and filtering functionality
- Structured data for SEO (schema.org)
- Accessibility enhancements (WCAG compliance)
- Analytics integration

These enhancements can be introduced without restructuring the site.
