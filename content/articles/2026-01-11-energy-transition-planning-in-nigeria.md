summary: Nigeria, committed to the 2015 Paris Accord, faces challenges in
  transitioning its oil and gas sector from fossil fuels to renewables while
  minimizing output disruptions. Oil companies like TotalEnergies are developing
  environmental plans with targets such as 40% GHG emission cuts by 2030 and
  net-zero by 2050, alongside $10 billion in African renewable investments,
  supported by government policies and corporate initiatives. Strategies include
  energy efficiency, methane capture, and tech integration like AI for process
  optimization and IoT for real-time monitoring across upstream, midstream, and
  downstream operations, though impediments such as cyber vulnerabilities and
  infrastructure gaps hinder adoption.

The global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources, as mandated by the 2015 Paris Accord, necessitates substantial efforts from countries
worldwide (Svobodova, 2020). Nigeria, a signatory to these commitments, faces intricate challenges in formulating and
implementing robust environmental plans for oil and gas companies to transition
within the stipulated timeframe and with minimal disruption to output (Ogunkan, 2022). This literature
review will critically explore existing scholarly works, focusing on the research
objectives, theoretical frameworks, government policies, and corporate social
initiatives. It will delve into the complexities of environmental planning
amidst the energy transition landscape in Nigeria.

Environmental Plans in
Nigeria's Oil and Gas Industry 

According
to (Nwozor, 2021) Nigeria's oil and
gas sector is undergoing a significant transformation to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and transition to a sustainable energy mix. Oil and gas companies in
the country are developing comprehensive environmental plans encompassing specific
targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These plans incorporate a
combination of measures, such as energy efficiency improvements, methane
capture, utilization, and the integration of renewable energy sources. Total Energies
has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 and
achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The company has also committed to
investing $10 billion in renewable energy projects in Africa by 2030 (TotalEnergies, 2023). Although the speed
of the transition will depend on the pace of change in government policies,
consumer behaviors and corresponding demand, Total Energies has embraced the
need to offer customers affordable, less carbon-intensive energy products, and
to lend support to partners and suppliers with their own low-carbon strategies.


Strategies and
Technology Integration

Oil
and gas companies in Nigeria are leveraging technology to develop innovative
environmental plans. (Ahmad, 2021) Stated that “Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is being employed to optimize production processes and
identify areas for improvement, thereby enhancing energy efficiency and
reducing emissions”. These technological advancements signify a proactive
approach by the industry toward sustainable energy goals. According to (Wanasinghe, 2020) “The Internet of
Things (IoT) is at the forefront of this digital transformation, enabling
seamless real-time data collection, processing, and analysis from a range of
equipment, processes, and operations to achieve these objectives. There are
various operations/applications in the upstream, midstream, and downstream
sectors (e.g., condition-based monitoring and location tracking) for which
IoT-enabled solutions have a significant impact and offer a range of
opportunities to increase socioeconomic benefits. However, there are several
impediments (e.g., vulnerability to cyber-attacks, lower technological
readiness for deploying in zone-0 and zone-1 hazardous environments,
unavailability of communication infrastructure, labor concerns, and maintenance
and obsolescence) that slow the pace of adoption of IoT technologies for regular
upstream, midstream, and downstream operations.” As noted by (Stacey, 1990) “Companies employ
various strategies and technologies tailored to their specific operations and
goals. This is why Methane capture and utilization, repurposing of flaring for
electricity generation, and energy efficiency enhancements have become prevalent
practices in the operations by the major oil and gas companies.
